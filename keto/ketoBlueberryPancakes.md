## Ingredients
- 1/4 cup coconut flour
- 3 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons melted coconut oil
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup substitute

1. Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat.
2. Whisk together the coconut flour, eggs, coconut oil, maple syrup substitute, baking powder, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt in a small mixing bowl until smooth and well combined.
3. Melt the butter on the griddle and use a 1/4 cup measure to scoop out 4 pancakes onto the griddle. Arrange blueberries evenly between the pancakes by pressing them into the batter on the griddle. When bubbles form and pop on the pancakes, carefully flip and continue cooking until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.
