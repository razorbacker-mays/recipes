# Pumpkin Chaffles
This is the BASIC chaffle recipe and nothing more is needed,
however adding 1 teaspoon of coconut flour + 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
will give these a better texture. Try adding a splash of vanilla or dash of cinnamon
for next level breakfast chaffles or use another type of cheese or seasoning
for a bread replacement.

This recipe makes 4 chaffles â€“ a serving is 2, so this makes 2 servings.
